BRousch's Kivy Installers

Scripts to simplify the installation of Kivy and Buildozer

Currently Supports:
  * Ubuntu 12.04

To Install Kivy:

  1. Find the right subfolder for your distro and Python version.
  2. Run the kivy_sysprep.sh script time.
  3. Go to your project dir (or wherever you want the virtualenv).
  4. Run the kivy_venv_stable.sh or kivy_venv_dev.sh script for your distro and Python using a relative or absolute path.

Example run for kivy_sysprep:
  * I'm running Ubuntu 12.04
  * kivy-installer is located at ~/kivy-installer
  * I want to use Kivy Stable version
  * I want to use Python2.7
  * `cd ~`
  * `~/kivy-installer/ubuntu/1204/python27/kivy_sysprep.sh`
  * Now my system is ready to create virtualenvs for Kivy Stable on Python 2.7!

Example run for venv:
  * My project is located at ~/myproj
  * `cd ~/myproj`
  * `~/kivy-installer/ubuntu/1204/python27/kivy_venv_stable.sh`
  * Now I have a virtualenv at ~/myproj/venv which is ready to run Kivy!

Notes on kivy_sysprep:
  * Run this once to prepare your system for Kivy with specified Python version.
  * You can run it again later to bring your dependencies back up to date.
  * It installs:
    * Kivy's and PyGame's system dependencies
    * Current Cython and NumPy via system-wide pip
    * System-wide PyGame from its Mercurial repository
    * On Python 2.7 it also installs OpenJDK 7 so you're ready to create Kivy apps for Android.

Notes on kivy_venv_stable:
  * Run this script to create a Kivy virtualenv for each of your projects.
  * This script installs the current stable version of Kivy from PyPI.
  * For Python 2.7, it creates a virtualenv with --system-site-packages enabled, and Kivy, Plyer, Pygments, Docutils, 
  and Buildozer installed.
  * For Python 3.3 it creates a virtualenv with --system-site-packages enabled, and Kivy, Plyer, Pygments, and Docutils 
  installed.

Notes on kivy_venv_dev:
  * Run this script to create a Kivy virtualenv for each of your projects.
  * This script installs the current development (master) version of Kivy from GitHub.
  * For Python 2.7, it creates a virtualenv with --system-site-packages enabled, and Kivy, Plyer, Pygments, Docutils, 
  and Buildozer installed.
  * For Python 3.3 it creates a virtualenv with --system-site-packages enabled, and Kivy, Plyer, Pygments, and Docutils 
  installed.

To Install Buildozer Only:

  1. Find the right subfolder for your distro and Python version.
  2. Run the buildozer_only.sh script time.
