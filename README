BRousch's Kivy Installers

Scripts to simplify the installation of Kivy.

Ubuntu 12.04

sysprep: Run this once to prepare your system for Kivy, or run it to bring 
your dependencies up to date. It installs Kivy's and PyGame's system 
dependencies, current Cython and NumPy via system-wide pip, and system-wide 
PyGame from its Mercurial repository. It also installs OpenJDK 7 so you're 
ready to create Kivy apps for Android.

virtualenv: Run this script to create a Kivy virtualenv for your current 
project. It creates a Python 2.7 virtualenv with --system-site-packages 
enabled, and Kivy, Plyer, and Buildozer installed.
